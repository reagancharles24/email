Subject: Contingency Proposal for Year 2000 Systems
</div>
<div class="body" id="e1body">Dr. Keats,

Following Friday’s Y2K mitigation briefing, the Department of Commerce is authorizing exploration of a rapid-decision contingency framework capable of addressing infrastructure-wide date logic failures without operator intervention.

Our primary concerns remain:
1. Speed – Response times must be measured in milliseconds, not minutes.
2. Flexibility – Must adapt to untested failure states.
3. Autonomy – No external human approval in emergency mode.

Your suggestion of embedding a human cognitive model into a machine-deployable environment is unconventional but merits review. The premise, as I understand it:

- Capture the real-time decision-making process of a qualified subject under simulated crisis load.
- Compile said process into executable logic, stripped of individual identity markers.
- Deploy into critical systems as a live failsafe during rollover period (December 31, 1999 – January 1, 2000).

Please provide within 14 days:
- Candidate selection criteria.
- Overview of “NeuroPattern Compilation” feasibility.
- Projected legal/ethical risk assessment.
- Proposed name for internal reference (temporary codename acceptable).

This project will be classified until further notice under the internal title Project 0:00.

Regards,
Evelyn Rourke

<div class="body" id="e2body">Evelyn,

Following your request for candidate selection criteria, I believe we have identified a highly suitable subject for NeuroPattern Compilation.

Candidate: Gideon Stroud
Position: Senior Systems Architect, Cerulean Systems – Infrastructure Division
Experience: Over 20 years in real-time failure mitigation for high-security installations, including nuclear energy facilities, air defense networks, and Tier-1 financial systems.
Clearances: Active Top Secret (DoD & DOE).

Rationale:
- Proven ability to make rapid, high-stakes operational decisions under severe pressure.
- Comprehensive knowledge of both legacy and modern architecture ensures adaptability during unpredictable rollover failures.
- Currently engaged in classified infrastructure failover simulations relevant to Y2K scenarios.
- Personal circumstances (degenerative motor condition) make him open to unconventional contract structures and high-intensity participation.

If approved, we can begin preliminary NeuroPattern baseline recordings within three weeks, pending legal clearance and informed consent procedures.

Regards,
Harlan Keats
Chief Technical Officer
Cerulean Systems, Inc.

Subject: Opportunity — Project 0:00 Participation
</div>
<div class="body" id="e3body">Gideon,

Following our recent Y2K readiness meetings, your name has come forward as a leading candidate for an advanced infrastructure failsafe program currently in development under Department of Commerce sponsorship.

Project 0:00 aims to create an adaptive, human-grade decision-making system capable of stabilizing critical infrastructure in the event of unpredictable date logic failures during the Year 2000 rollover. Your extensive experience in high-stakes systems recovery, combined with your long-term service record here at Cerulean, positions you as uniquely qualified to contribute in a direct and lasting way.

Participation would involve a short-term, intensive engagement over the next 10–12 months, with technical sessions to capture your real-time crisis response methodology under controlled simulation. The process has been designed for minimal physical strain, and we are prepared to structure your working conditions to suit your preferences — location, schedule, and methods — within the limits of the project’s operational budget.

If you are open to discussion, I’d like to schedule a confidential briefing to walk you through the scope, security protocols, and potential long-term benefits to both you and the national infrastructure resilience effort.

This is a rare opportunity to leave an enduring mark on the systems you’ve helped protect for decades.

Regards,
Harlan Keats
Chief Technical Officer
Cerulean Systems, Inc.

<div class="body" id="e4body">Harlan,

Thank you for considering me for this role. I have read the preliminary outline and I understand the urgency of this work in the context of the Y2K transition.

I’m willing to participate, with the understanding that the nature of this project is both unusual and final. If my decision-making profile is to be recorded and translated into machine logic, I request the following conditions:

1. Family Provision — Cerulean will guarantee ongoing financial support for my wife, Elaine, and our two children for a period of no less than twenty years, regardless of project outcome. This must be documented and legally binding.
2. Non-Conscious Implementation — I am agreeing to share my professional instincts, not my personal identity. The programming should not be capable of thinking as I do beyond the scope of crisis decision-making. It should not retain my awareness, memories, or emotions.
3. Medical Accommodation — All participation will be structured to minimize physical strain. Sessions will be scheduled around my current health requirements.

I understand the confidentiality requirements and will comply fully. This may be the final contribution I can make in my career, and I want it to count — both for the systems I’ve worked to protect, and for the security of my family after I’m gone.

If these terms can be met, I will move forward with the next steps.

Regards,
Gideon Stroud
Senior Systems Architect

<div class="body" id="e5body">Gideon,

We have reviewed your conditions for participation and can confirm that Cerulean Systems, in coordination with the Department of Commerce, agrees to each of your listed terms:

1. Family Provision — A twenty-year guaranteed financial support contract will be executed and placed under legal seal prior to the start of any NeuroPattern recording sessions.
2. Non-Conscious Implementation — The compiled program will be engineered strictly for adaptive decision-making under emergency conditions. Per your request, personal memory and self-awareness will not be preserved in the operational framework.
3. Medical Accommodation — All recording procedures will be conducted in controlled, low-impact environments, with session schedules adapted to your health requirements.

Your expertise and willingness to serve in this capacity are greatly appreciated. We believe this work will provide a lasting safeguard for critical infrastructure well beyond the Year 2000 transition.

We propose to begin preliminary NeuroPattern baseline mapping on Monday, December 14, 1998, at our Research Annex B-12 in Jersey City. This will be a closed session with only essential project personnel present.

Please confirm your availability so we can finalize travel and logistical arrangements.

Regards,
Harlan Keats
